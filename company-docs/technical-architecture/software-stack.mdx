## Software Stack & Control Plane

FarmGPU's software stack is designed to **operate AI infrastructure at scale with minimal human overhead**, while preserving performance, transparency, and control. Rather than relying on proprietary cloud control planes, FarmGPU builds on **open-source, Linux-native primitives**, extended with purpose-built systems for GPU operations.

Together, these components form a **unified control plane** for provisioning, operating, observing, and optimizing AI clusters.

## TractorOS — The NeoCloud Operating System

**TractorOS** is FarmGPU's minimal, immutable, container-native operating system optimized specifically for AI compute.

### What TractorOS Does

- Provides a hardened, reproducible OS image for GPU and storage nodes
- Ships with **built-in GPU, networking, and storage drivers**
- Enables **zero-touch provisioning and fleet-wide upgrades**
- Eliminates configuration drift across clusters

### Key Characteristics

- Linux-based (RHEL-derived)
- Immutable image-based updates
- Container-first runtime model
- Designed for bare metal AI infrastructure, not VMs

TractorOS allows FarmGPU to deploy and scale GPU fleets rapidly while maintaining **predictable behavior across thousands of nodes**.

## Homestead — Bare-Metal Provisioning & Lifecycle Management

**Homestead** is the entry point for every FarmGPU server.

### What Homestead Does

- Bare-metal provisioning via Redfish and Ansible
- Hardware discovery and inventory
- Initial OS deployment and configuration
- Support for KVM VMs and LXC containers where needed

Homestead ensures that servers move from **rack to production** with minimal manual intervention, forming the foundation for repeatable cluster deployments.

## Shepherd — System Health, Reliability & Diagnostics

**Shepherd** is FarmGPU's system health evaluation platform, designed to make AI infrastructure **observable, debuggable, and predictable**.

### What Shepherd Monitors

- GPU health and performance (via NVIDIA DCGM)
- Network health and packet loss
- Storage latency and throughput
- Host-level metrics and anomalies

### Advanced Capabilities

- Predictive failure detection
- Agentic diagnostics and root-cause analysis
- Automated incident summaries and reports
- Integration with observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Alloy)

Shepherd enables FarmGPU to move from **reactive monitoring** to **proactive reliability**, reducing downtime and improving SLA adherence.

---

## Silo — Storage Infrastructure & Benchmarking

**Silo** is FarmGPU's storage evaluation and optimization platform.

### What Silo Does

- Deploys and benchmarks block, file, and object storage systems
- Evaluates storage performance under AI workloads
- Performs hardware discovery and tuning
- Validates storage configurations before production rollout

Silo is used internally to benchmark platforms such as MinIO, VAST Data, Weka, and Ceph, ensuring that storage performance is **measured, repeatable, and workload-aware**.

## Haystack — AI Workload Profiling & Optimization

**Haystack** provides workload-level visibility into how AI jobs consume infrastructure.

### What Haystack Measures

- GPU utilization by workload
- Storage I/O patterns
- Network usage and contention
- Differences between training, fine-tuning, and inference jobs

This enables:

- Per-workload optimization
- Capacity planning based on real usage
- Improved scheduling and cost efficiency
- Better matching of workloads to hardware profiles

Haystack helps FarmGPU optimize **goodput**, not just raw utilization.

---

## Automation, Observability & Drivers (Underlying Stack)

Across all systems, FarmGPU standardizes on proven, open tooling:

### Automation

- **Ansible** for configuration and orchestration

### Observability

- **Grafana**
- **Prometheus**
- **Loki**
- **Alloy**
- **Node Exporter**
- **NVIDIA DCGM**
- **cAdvisor**

### Drivers & Acceleration

- NVIDIA GPU drivers
- SPDK for NVMe
- NVIDIA DOCA / OFED for networking and DPU acceleration

This approach keeps the stack **transparent, auditable, and extensible**, while avoiding vendor lock-in.

---

## Why This Software Stack Matters

FarmGPU's software stack is not a SaaS product suite—it is **operational leverage**.

It enables:

- Faster cluster bring-up
- Higher GPU utilization
- Lower operational overhead
- Predictable performance at scale
- Rapid adoption of new hardware generations

By building a Linux-native, hardware-aware control plane, FarmGPU achieves **hyperscaler-level operational maturity without hyperscaler complexity or cost**.
