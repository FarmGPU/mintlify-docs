# Mission, Vision, and Positioning

## Mission

FarmGPU empowers the AI revolution by delivering **secure, high-performance, and cost-efficient GPU infrastructure** purpose-built for modern AI workloads.

We provide on-demand and dedicated GPU servers through **secure, local data centers**, and we partner deeply across hardware, platform software, and emerging technologies to build a **scalable NeoCloud ecosystem**. Our mission is to **decentralize and democratize AI infrastructure**, giving builders real alternatives to hyperscalers—without sacrificing performance, security, or control.

---

## Vision

We envision a world where **open and sovereign AI wins**.

In this future:

- AI infrastructure is **local, auditable, and secure by default**
- Builders retain **full control over their data, models, and economics**
- Open standards and open ecosystems outpace closed hyperscaler platforms
- Specialized NeoClouds compete head-to-head with hyperscalers on performance, cost, and reliability

FarmGPU's long-term vision is to be a **foundational NeoCloud provider**—powering AI innovation globally while remaining capital-efficient, standards-driven, and aligned with the communities that build AI, not monopolize it.

## Category Definition: The NeoCloud

> NeoCloud: A specialized cloud provider purpose-built for AI workloads

Unlike hyperscalers, NeoClouds:

- Are **GPU-first**, not CPU-centric
- Optimize for **real AI workloads**, not generic VMs
- Deliver **dramatically better price-performance**

# Strategic Positioning

## High Performance, Low Cost

FarmGPU delivers **up to 70% lower total cost of ownership (TCO)** compared to major hyperscalers, without compromising performance or reliability.

We achieve this through:

- Optimized BOMs tuned for AI workloads
- Lean team leveraging AI for everything
- Deep hardware–software co-optimization
- Transparent pricing aligned to actual infrastructure costs

Rather than monetizing lock-in or proprietary services, FarmGPU aligns incentives with customers: **better utilization, better performance, lower cost**.

## 3.2 NeoCloud for Real-World AI: Storage as a First-Class Citizen

AI workloads are **not compute-only**. Training, fine-tuning, and inference at scale demand **fast, reliable, and predictable storage**—something most NeoClouds and bare-metal GPU providers underinvest in.

FarmGPU is uniquely positioned as a **storage-centric NeoCloud**.

We differentiate by:

- Designing storage as a **core architectural pillar**, not an afterthought
- Partnering with industry leaders like **Solidigm** and major storage ISVs
- Deploying **custom storage servers** tuned for AI workloads
- Leveraging **DPU-accelerated architectures (NVIDIA BlueField-3)** to offload storage, networking, and security from CPUs
- Supporting **AI-native storage patterns**, including:
    - KV-cache offload for inference
    - Vector databases
    - High-throughput block, file, and object storage

This approach enables FarmGPU to deliver **predictable performance at scale**—from small research clusters to enterprise and production AI systems.

## 3.3 The Trust Layer

Trust is foundational to AI infrastructure. FarmGPU is building a **defense-in-depth trust layer** that spans hardware, software, and operations.

### Security & Compliance

- **SOC 2 Type II** (in progress)
- Zero-trust networking model
- Hardware-enforced isolation using DPUs
- Secure lifecycle management of storage and compute assets

### Confidential Computing

FarmGPU is one of the few NeoClouds investing early in **end-to-end confidential computing** for GPUs:

- Intel **TDX** support with NVIDIA B200
- Secure enclaves for sensitive AI workloads
- AMD **SEV** support planned for **Q2 2026**
- Architecture designed to protect data **in use**, not just at rest or in transit

### Why This Matters

This trust layer enables:

- Regulated and sensitive workloads (enterprise, government, research)
- Model protection and IP isolation
- Verifiable data handling and sanitization
- Long-term customer confidence as AI regulation increases
