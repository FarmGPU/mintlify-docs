# Compliance and Standards

FarmGPU's security posture is built on **alignment with established standards**, clear separation of responsibilities, and a roadmap toward formal certifications as the company scales. We prioritize **practical security controls, auditability, and transparency** over checkbox compliance.

---

## Compliance Philosophy

FarmGPU follows a **shared responsibility model**:

- **FarmGPU** is responsible for the security of the platform, management plane, and operational processes.
- **Data center partners** are responsible for physical security, facility controls, and environmental resilience.
- **Customers** retain control over their workloads, data, and application-level security.

This model aligns with industry best practices for infrastructure providers and enables enterprise customers to clearly map controls to risk ownership.
