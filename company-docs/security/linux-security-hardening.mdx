# Linux & OS Security (TractorOS)

FarmGPU's operating system, **TractorOS**, is built on established Linux security best practices and extended with targeted hardening techniques designed for AI infrastructure. The goal is to **reduce attack surface, enforce consistency, and limit blast radius**, while preserving performance for GPU- and storage-intensive workloads.

---

## Secure OS Baseline & Attack Surface Reduction

TractorOS follows a **minimal, hardened Linux baseline** designed to reduce unnecessary exposure.

Key practices include:

- Minimal OS footprint with only required services enabled
- Removal of unused packages, daemons, and subsystems
- No interactive user accounts on production nodes
- Controlled administrative access via centralized tooling only

These practices reduce the number of reachable services and limit opportunities for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

## Kernel & Runtime Hardening

The Linux kernel and runtime configuration are hardened using widely adopted security controls.

Key measures:

- Conservative kernel configuration aligned with security best practices
- Signed kernel modules and restricted module loading
- Hardened sysctl settings (memory protection, process isolation, ptrace restrictions)
- Enforced memory protections (ASLR, NX, KPTI where applicable)

Security settings are evaluated alongside performance requirements to avoid negatively impacting GPU or storage throughput.

## Storage & Device Security

TractorOS treats storage and hardware devices as **security-sensitive resources**, not just performance components.

Controls include:

- Enforced device isolation for GPUs, NVMe, and NICs
- No direct access to raw block devices by tenant workloads
- Hardware-backed encryption at rest (SEDs) enabled by default
- Secure device lifecycle handling, including cryptographic erase before reuse

These measures help ensure that data remains protected even in multi-tenant and hardware-reuse scenarios.

## TractorOS-Specific Hardening Techniques

In addition to standard Linux practices, TractorOS incorporates several platform-specific controls:

- **Immutable OS images:**

    The base OS is read-only and updated atomically, preventing configuration drift and persistent compromise.

- **Deterministic provisioning:**

    Nodes are provisioned from known-good images with repeatable configuration.

- **Explicit trust boundaries:**

    Clear separation between the host OS, management services, and customer workloads.

- **Observable state:**

    OS state and system events are continuously monitored and logged for audit and incident response.

These techniques enable FarmGPU to maintain **consistent security posture across fleets**, while supporting rapid recovery and rollback if issues arise.
