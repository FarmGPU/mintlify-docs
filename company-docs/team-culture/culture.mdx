# Culture

FarmGPU is built for a world where infrastructure is expensive, latency is real, and reliability is earned. We optimize for **leverage**, **speed**, and **truth**—with a small team operating systems that cannot afford hand-waving.

## 1) AI-First in Everything

We treat AI as a multiplier across engineering, operations, security, GTM, and finance. Our default is to replace repetitive work with automation and to use AI to compress feedback loops.

**How this shows up**

- AI-assisted incident triage (summaries, hypothesis generation, diffing changes)
- Auto-updated runbooks and SOPs from postmortems
- Faster documentation, RFP responses, and security questionnaires (human-reviewed)
- Internal tools that eliminate manual work

**Guardrail:** AI increases speed, but **humans remain accountable** for correctness and customer impact.

## 2) High Agency & Extreme Ownership

We use "agency" as: **the ability to independently identify problems, make decisions, and execute** without waiting for permission—while being accountable for outcomes.

**How this shows up**

- See a bottleneck? You drive it end-to-end: diagnose → fix → validate → document.
- Strong opinions, loosely held: decide quickly, update beliefs faster.
- We reward people who "close the loop," not people who create meetings.

## 3) Builders, Not Tourists

We build and operate real infrastructure. Everyone is expected to be close enough to the work to understand failure modes and performance tradeoffs.

## 4) Systems Thinking

AI infrastructure is a system. We value people who can reason across layers: silicon → firmware → kernel → network → storage → workload performance.

**How this shows up**

- We optimize for **goodput** (useful work delivered), not vanity metrics
- Changes require a hypothesis + measurement plan
- Postmortems focus on systemic fixes, not blame

## 5) Radically Transparent

We share context broadly because small teams move faster when they have the full picture.

**How this shows up**

- Key metrics are visible internally (utilization, uptime, MFU, capacity, economics)
- Clear written decisions: what we decided, why, what we'll measure
- Fast postmortems with tracked action items

**Guardrail:** We protect customer confidentiality and sensitive security details.

## 6) Direct Communication (Kind, Clear, Fast)

We value direct communication because speed and reliability require clarity. We aim to be **straightforward, low-drama, and solution-oriented**—especially when stakes are high (incidents, customer impact, security).

**What it means**

- Say the thing that needs to be said, early.
- Prefer facts, logs, and measurements over opinions.
- Disagree openly, then commit and execute.

**How this shows up**

- Short, explicit asks: "I need X by Y to unblock Z."
- Clear incident updates: "Impact, current hypothesis, next steps, ETA for next update."
- Written decisions when it matters: what we chose, why, and what would change our mind.

**Guardrails**

- Direct ≠ rude. We default to **respect and professionalism**.
- Critique ideas and systems, not people.
- If you spot a problem, propose a path forward.
