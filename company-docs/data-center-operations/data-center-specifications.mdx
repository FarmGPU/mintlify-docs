FarmGPU's data center infrastructure is primarily hosted at a tier 3 datacenter in Rancho Cordova, CA called Conscious Capital Data Center. We meet our most stringent partner requirements for 99.99% availability, ensuring enterprise-grade reliability, security, and performance for AI workloads.

## Power Infrastructure

- Dual independent utility feeds from separate substations, each capable of supporting 100% of data center load
- N+1 redundant UPS systems with minimum 15-minute runtime at full load
- N+1 redundant generator systems with 48-hour on-site fuel storage
- 2N redundant power distribution paths from utility to rack level
- Remote power monitoring and management at rack level
- Monthly generator load testing and quarterly full-load system tests
- 24/7 on-site facilities team for immediate response

## Network Architecture

- Minimum 100 Gbps total bandwidth capacity
- Dual diverse internet circuits from separate providers with BGP routing
- Redundant core switches in high-availability configuration
- DDoS protection solutions
- Performance guarantees:
    - Sub-80% network utilization during peak hours
    - Less than 0.1% packet loss
    - P95 round-trip time under 4ms within data center
    - P95 jitter under 3ms within data center

## Security and Compliance

- ISO 27001 certified data center
- 24/7 on-site security personnel
- Isolated secure racks with restricted access
- Comprehensive access logging and monitoring
- Regular security audits and compliance reviews
- Tier III+ data center standards compliance

## Environmental Controls

- Advanced liquid cooling systems for optimal GPU performance
- N+1 redundancy for cooling infrastructure
- Real-time environmental monitoring and alerts
- Regular thermal imaging and preventive maintenance

FarmGPU is compliant with the RunPod secure cloud data center and network specifications below

## **3. Data Center Power Requirements**

| **Requirement** | **Specification** |
| --- | --- |
| Utility Feeds | Minimum of two independent utility feeds from separate substations. Each feed capable of supporting 100% of the data center's power load. Automatic transfer switches (ATS) for seamless switchover between feeds with UL 1008 certification (or regional equivalent) |
| UPS | - N+1 redundancy for UPS systems- Minimum of 15 minutes runtime at full load |
| Generators | N+1 redundancy for generator systems. Generators must be able to support 100% of the data center's power load. Minimum of 48 hours of on-site fuel storage at full load. Automatic transfer to generator power within 10 seconds of utility failure |
| Power Distribution | Redundant power distribution paths (2N) from utility to rack level. Redundant Power Distribution Units (PDUs) in each rack. Remote power monitoring and management capabilities at rack level |
| Testing and Maintenance | Monthly generator tests under load for a minimum of 30 minutes. Quarterly full-load tests of the entire backup power system, including UPS and generators. Annual full-facility power outage test (coordinated with Runpod). Regular thermographic scanning of electrical systems. Detailed maintenance logs for all power equipment. 24/7 on-site facilities team for immediate response to power issues |
| Monitoring and Alerting | Real-time monitoring of all power systems. Automated alerting for any power anomalies or threshold breaches |
| Capacity Planning | Maintain a minimum of 20% spare power capacity for future growth. Annual power capacity audits and forecasting |
| Fire Suppression | Maintain datacenter fire suppression systems in compliance with NFPA 75 and 76 (or regional equivalent) |

## **4. Network Requirements**

| **Requirement** | **Specification** |
| --- | --- |
| Internet Connectivity | Minimum of two diverse and redundant internet circuits from separate providers. Each connection should be capable of supporting 100% of the data center's bandwidth requirements. BGP routing implemented for automatic failover between circuit providers. 100 Gbps minimum total bandwidth capacity |
| Speed Requirements | Preferred: >= 10 Gbps sustained upload/download speed per server. Minimum: >= 5 Gbps sustained upload/download speed per server. Speed measurements should be based on sustained throughput over a 60 second interval during a typical workload |
| Core Infrastructure | Redundant core switches in a high-availability configuration (e.g., stacking, VSS, or equivalent) |
| Distribution Layer | Redundant distribution switches with multi-chassis link aggregation (MLAG) or equivalent technology. Minimum 100 Gbps uplinks to core switches |
| Access Layer | Redundant top-of-rack switches in each cabinet. Minimum 100 Gbps server connections for high-performance compute nodes |
| DDoS Protection | Must have a DDoS mitigation solution, either on-premises or on-demand cloud-based |
| Quality of service | Maintain network performance within the following parameters: Network utilization levels must remain below 80% on any link during peak hours. Packet loss must not exceed 0.1% (1 in 1000) on any network segment. P95 round-trip time (RTT) within the data center should not exceed 4ms. P95 jitter within the datacenter should not exceed 3ms |
| Testing and Maintenance | Regular failover testing of all redundant components (minimum semi-annually). Annual full-scale disaster recovery test. Maintenance windows for network updates and patches, with minimal service disruption scheduled at least 1 week in advance |
| Capacity Planning | Maintain a minimum of 40% spare network capacity for future growth. Regular network performance audits and capacity forecasting |
