# 1.3 Why FarmGPU Exists (Founders’ Thesis)

## 1) Why On-Demand Compute Beats Traditional Cloud

The cloud promised flexibility, efficiency, and access to cutting-edge infrastructure. For AI workloads, that promise is only partially fulfilled.

Hyperscalers were designed around **general-purpose, multi-tenant computing**. Their abstractions—virtual machines, managed services, quotas, and proprietary platforms—optimize for scale and control, not for GPU efficiency or developer autonomy. For AI teams, this creates fundamental friction:

- **High and unpredictable costs** driven by opaque pricing, egress fees, and bundled services
- **Limited access** to GPUs due to quotas, regional scarcity, and long reservation cycles
- **Vendor lock-in** that restricts portability and experimentation
- **Inefficient utilization**, with GPUs frequently stalled by I/O and networking bottlenecks

On-demand GPU compute flips this model.

By providing **direct, hardware-proximate access** to GPU infrastructure—without proprietary abstractions—on-demand platforms allow AI teams to:

- Scale up or down instantly
- Pay only for what they use
- Maintain full control of their software stack
- Optimize performance without cloud-imposed constraints

For modern AI workloads, **on-demand, infrastructure-native compute is not a compromise—it is the optimal model**.

| Cloud Promise | Description | Reality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scalability & Agility | Resources can be rapidly scaled to meet changing demands. | Partly true. Vendor lock-in is real. |
| Cost Efficiency | Pay-as-you-go model, eliminating upfront hardware investments. | False. Cloud can be extremely expensive. |
| Innovation & Flexibility | Access to cutting-edge technology for fast experimentation. | False. Limited or no access to entry-level GPUs. |
| Reliability & Security | Global data centers ensure data availability and security. | True. CSPs take durability, availability, and security very seriously. |
| Global Reach | Facilitates global collaboration through worldwide infrastructure. | True. Easy access to various regions. |

## 2) Why FarmGPU Wins with Storage Expertise

Compute does not bottleneck AI systems—**data movement does**.

Most GPU cloud providers treat storage as a secondary concern, relying on generic network-attached solutions that are poorly suited for AI workloads. This leads to:

- GPUs waiting on data
- Inconsistent performance
- Poor scaling behavior
- Hidden costs as datasets grow

FarmGPU was built around a different insight: **storage is the performance moat in AI infrastructure**.

We design and operate storage as a first-class system component:

- Deep partnerships with storage leaders like **Solidigm** and leading storage ISVs
- Custom storage servers optimized for AI data paths
- **DPU-accelerated architectures (NVIDIA BlueField-3)** to offload networking, security, and storage processing from CPUs
- Native support for **AI-specific storage patterns**, including:
    - High-throughput training pipelines
    - KV-cache offload for inference
    - Vector databases and embedding workloads
    - Block, file, and object storage tuned for GPUs

This storage-centric approach delivers:

- Higher GPU utilization (MFU)
- Predictable performance under real workloads
- Lower cost per unit of useful compute

As models grow larger and inference becomes more data-intensive, **storage expertise becomes the primary differentiator**. This is where FarmGPU has a durable advantage.

## 3) The Roadmap to the Lowest TCO in AI Infrastructure

FarmGPU’s long-term advantage is not tied to any single GPU generation—it is rooted in **systems-level cost optimization**.

Our roadmap to the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) is built on three pillars:

### Open Source and Linux Leadership

We embrace open systems at every layer:

- Custom neocloud OS with Tractor
- Open networking with OCP

This reduces licensing costs, increases transparency, and allows continuous optimization as hardware evolves.

### Optimized Data Center Design

Instead of overbuilt hyperscale facilities, we deploy **AI-optimized data centers**:

- High-density GPU racks, tuned to existing DC footprints
- Power and cooling designed around real GPU thermals
- Incremental upgrades of existing Tier III / IV facilities
- Capital deployed only when demand exists

This approach lowers CapEx, accelerates deployment, and improves return on invested capital.

### Network and Fabric Efficiency

AI performance depends on fast, predictable communication:

- High-bandwidth, low-latency fabrics
- DPU-offloaded networking and security
- Topologies designed for collective communication, not web traffic

By treating networking as part of the compute system—not an external service—we reduce both latency and cost.
