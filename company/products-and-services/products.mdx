# 2. Products & Services

FarmGPU delivers GPU infrastructure in two primary ways: **on-demand cloud access** and **managed GPU infrastructure**. Both offerings are designed to give customers high-performance AI compute without the complexity, cost, or lock-in of hyperscaler clouds.

---

## 2.1 On-Demand GPU Cloud (via RunPod)

FarmGPU operates high-performance GPU clusters that are available on-demand through our platform partnerships, including **RunPod**.

This offering is designed for:

- AI startups and developers
- Researchers and experimentation teams
- Fine-tuning and inference workloads
- Customers who need instant access without long-term commitments

### Key Characteristics

- On-demand access to GPU servers
- Hourly or usage-based pricing
- Fast provisioning and teardown
- Bare-metal or near-metal performance
- No long-term contracts or quotas

### What Customers Get

- Direct access to modern GPUs optimized for AI workloads
- Predictable performance without hyperscaler abstractions
- Transparent pricing aligned to actual infrastructure costs
- A simple path from experimentation to production

FarmGPU’s on-demand cloud provides the **speed and flexibility of cloud**, with the **performance and economics of purpose-built infrastructure**.

## 2.2 Dedicated Bare-Metal GPU Rentals (Long-Term)

For customers with sustained workloads, FarmGPU offers **dedicated, long-term bare-metal GPU rentals**.

This product is designed for:

- Training large models
- Continuous inference workloads
- Enterprises seeking predictable cost and performance
- Customers transitioning off hyperscalers

### Key Characteristics

- Fully dedicated GPU servers or clusters
- Monthly or multi-year terms
- Customer-controlled software stack
- No noisy neighbors
- Fixed, predictable pricing

### What Customers Get

- Maximum GPU utilization and performance
- Full control over operating systems, drivers, and frameworks
- Stable costs independent of cloud pricing changes
- Infrastructure that behaves like owned hardware—without the CapEx

This offering combines the **control of ownership** with the **flexibility of leasing**, making it ideal for production AI systems.

---

## 2.3 Managed GPU Infrastructure (Customer-Owned or Partner-Owned)

FarmGPU also operates and manages GPU clusters on behalf of customers who **own or control their own hardware** but lack the expertise or resources to run it efficiently.

This product is designed for:

- Data center operators with unused GPU capacity
- Enterprises that have purchased GPUs but lack AI infrastructure expertise
- Investors or consortiums deploying GPU capital
- Organizations seeking on-prem or hybrid AI deployments

### Scope of Management

FarmGPU provides end-to-end operational management, including:

- Cluster bring-up and configuration
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Storage and networking integration
- Monitoring, telemetry, and alerting
- Security hardening and isolation
- Lifecycle management and upgrades

### What Customers Get

- Faster time to production
- Higher GPU utilization
- Reduced operational risk
- A professionally operated AI infrastructure stack
- Optional integration into marketplace or on-demand offerings

In effect, FarmGPU turns **idle or underutilized GPUs into production-grade AI infrastructure**.

## 2.4 Choosing the Right Offering

| Customer Need                         | Recommended Product              |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------- |
| Short-term or experimental workloads  | On-Demand GPU Cloud              |
| Long-running or production workloads  | Dedicated Bare-Metal GPU Rentals |
| Owned GPUs without internal expertise | Managed GPU Infrastructure       |
| On-prem or hybrid AI deployments      | Managed GPU Infrastructure       |

---

## Summary

FarmGPU does not sell software licenses or abstract cloud services. We sell **high-performance GPU infrastructure**, delivered in the form that best matches each customer’s needs:

- On-demand access when flexibility matters
- Dedicated infrastructure when performance and cost predictability matter
- Managed operations when expertise is the bottleneck

This product strategy allows FarmGPU to serve the full lifecycle of AI workloads—from experimentation to production—without forcing customers into a single deployment model.
